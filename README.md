# TeachUs
TeachUs is a community by teachers, for teachers.

## Motivation
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about a shift in the education sector of the world. In this new era of online teaching, we aim to help educators make the shift to the online mode. 

## About TeachUs
We aim to connect teachers across India to come forth and teach each other how to shift to the online mode of education. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced both students and teachers alike to rely on online resources to learn and teach.
For many teachers, this shift has been far from pleasant.
We offer many courses and resources to make your journey in online teaching as smooth as possible. We have created a community for teachers where they can share their thoughts and views regarding anything and everything - be it the latest tool to conduct pop quizzes, or the best tool to conduct meetings virtually.
