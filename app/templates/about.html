											 <h3> TeachUs is a community by teachers, for teachers. </h3>
											<p>We aim to connect teachers across India to come forth and teach each other how to shift to the online mode of education. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced both students and teachers alike to rely on online resources to learn and teach. </p> </li>
											<p>For many teachers, this shift has been far from pleasant.</p>
									<p>We offer many courses and resources to make your journey in online teaching as smooth as possible. We have created a community for teachers where you can share your thoughts and views regarding anything and everything - be it the latest tool to conduct pop quizzes, or the best tool to conduct meetings virtually.
									</p>
									<p>TeachUs aims to teach those who have spent years teaching us :)</p>

									<p>We are sophomores from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. Driven by a desire to help our teachers adjust to this new normal, we decided to build TeachUs - an app to teach those who have spent years teaching us!</p>
